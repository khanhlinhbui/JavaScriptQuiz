# JavaScript Quiz
## About
This project creates a coding quiz on JavaScript fundamentals, based on a timer. If the user answers the question correctly, it will present you to the next question. If the user answers the question incorrectly, the time is subtracted from the clock. The quiz is over if all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. After that, the user can save initials with the corresponding score, using local storage.
